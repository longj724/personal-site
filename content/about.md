I'm Justin Long, a junior at the University of Michigan. I currently live in Ann Arbor, but grew up and went to high school in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. I am studying computer science, and am also interested in entrepreneurship and psychology. Outside of school, I am very passionate about running and endurance sports.

# Recent Events and What I'm Doing Now

I spent last summer interning at Adatasol, a small SaaS company. I worked with Filemaker, a relational database application used for building web applications, and
engaged in market research for a new CPQ sales software.

I also worked for The Coding School, where I spent a few hours a week teaching a high school student Python.
In my free time, I worked on multiple side projects (mainly full-stack web applications) and made a
contribution to an open-source web application called Gitpay, which has over 70 other contributors.

I am currently looking for internship opportunities for the summer of 2021.
