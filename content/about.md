Hi, I'm Justin, and I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan. I currently live in Ann Arbor, but grew up and went to highschool in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. I am studying computer science, and am also interested in entrepreneurship and psychology. Outside of school I am very passionate aboute running, and endurance sports. I also enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, and watching Cleveland sports. 

# What I am Up to Right Now

My focus is on my academics as it is the middle of the fall semester. I am also looking for internship opportunities as a software engineer for the
summer of 2020.

As it relates to programming, this semester, I joined the University of Michigan Mars Rover Team. I am gaining experience collaborating with other developers and learning how to make changes to large existing code bases safely. More specifically, I am working on constructing a new state machine for the Rover that will allow it to complete tasks added to the 2020 University Mars Rover Challenge.
