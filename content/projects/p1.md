This is of the main projects I've been working on while learning Javascript. It is nothing extremely complex but it has been a good way for me to practice implementing different features (which I plan on doing more of). It is only hosted locally, but "users" can sign in with their email and create a virtual book shelf that tracks books they have read and books they want to read. I used Cloud Firestore for the database and the Google Books API to retrieve the book covers.
