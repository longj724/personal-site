This is of the main projects I've been working on while learning Javascript. It is nothing extremely complex but has served as  way for me to practice implementing different features. It is only hosted locally using Express, but "users" can sign in with their email and create a virtual book shelf that tracks books they have read and books they want to read. I used the Google Books API to allow users to search for books and retrieve information about them. I also used NodeJS and Puppeteer to scrape the website of my local library to find if the book is available there.
