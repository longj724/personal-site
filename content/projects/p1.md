This is of the main projects I've been working on while learning Javascript. It has served as a good platform for me to practice implementing different features that are common in web apps. It is only hosted locally using Express, but "users" can sign in with their email and create a virtual book shelf that tracks books they have read and books they want to read. I used the Google Books API to allow users to search for books and retrieve information about them. I also used NodeJS and Puppeteer to scrape the website of my local library to find if the ebook version of the book is available.
